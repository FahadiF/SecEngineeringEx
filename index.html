                Task 1 (Summary): What measures have you taken to protect yourself from cyber crimes? Write a short
                description of the actions you have done to fortify your defenses towards all sorts of cyber crimes.
                Have you been a victim of cyber crimes and do you think you could have prevented them? For example
                phishing and malware attacks. What could you improve on?

                <p>
                    I am using a premium Antivirus to protect my Windows operated PC against viruses, malwares and
                    attacks from untrusted sources. I use an opensource password manager to store my passowords and
                    generate strong password for each and every website or application. Also use 2FA when possible. I've
                    installed adblocker and vpn on browsers and avoid opening untrusted links. And I try to keep all the
                    softwares and applications up to date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been a victim of serious cyber attacks twice in my life. Once I got all my files encrypted by
                    a ransomware attack, and the second time my personal information and data was stolen by a malware.
                    Both of these attacks happened because I have used Modded OS and Softwares from untrusted sources. I
                    was able to decrypt my data without payingthe ransom by using a free decryption tool by kaspersky.
                    But I lost a lot my personal data and information in the second attack. I could have prevented these
                    attacks by avoiding using modded OS and softwares, and using trusted sources only.

                    <h4>Issue Statement:</h4>
                    <p>The employees are responsible for keeping our passwords safe. Passwords are the first line of defense

Don‚Äôt share your passwords with anyone, and keep them stored in a safe place (maybe a password manager).</p>

                    <h4>Applicability:</h4>
                    <p>This applies to all employees who use company systems, accounts, or anything with sensitive data.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Roles and Responsibilities:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Employees:</strong> Create strong passwords and change them regularly.</li>
                        <li><strong>IT department:</strong> Make sure that all systems are well protected and assist if there‚Äôs a problem with the system or passwords.</li>
                        <li><strong>Management:</strong> Make sure everyone knows the password policies and give training if needed.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Compliance:</h4>
                    <p>If you don‚Äôt follow this policy, you may face consequences like account lockouts or warnings.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Points of Contact and Supplementary Information:</h4>
                    <p>If you need help with passwords, reach out to the IT Support team.</p>
