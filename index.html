                    I am using a premium Antivirus to protect my Windows operated PC against viruses, malwares and attacks from untrusted sources. I use an opensource password manager to store my passowords and generate strong password for each and every website or application. Also use 2FA when possible. I've installed adblocker and vpn on browsers and avoid opening untrusted links. And I try to keep all the softwares and applications up to date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been a victim of serious cyber attacks twice in my life. Once I got all my files encrypted by a ransomware attack, and the second time my personal information and data was stolen by a malware. Both of these attacks happened because I have used Modded OS and Softwares from untrusted sources. I was able to decrypt my data without payingthe ransom by using a free decryption tool by kaspersky. But I lost a lot my personal data and information in the second attack. I could have prevented these attacks by avoiding using modded OS and softwares, and using trusted sources only.
