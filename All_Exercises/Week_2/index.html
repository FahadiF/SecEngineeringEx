                    <span class="icon">‚úÖ</span>
                    <p><strong>1. What does the "Not Secure" warning mean in the first picture and what risks does
                            visiting sites with the warning pose?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        The "Not Secure" warning on the first site means the website is using HTTP (HyperText Transfer
                        Protocol) instead
                        of HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure). This means that the connection between the
                        user and the website is not encrypted.
                        <br><br>
                        Visting sites like this involve a risk of man-in-the-middle attacks where hackers can intercept
                        and manipulate the data we're sending. If we're entering sensitive information like passwords or
                        credit card details, it could be easily stolen.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>2. Why does the second site show up as "trusted" to the browser?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        The second site (danskesbank.io) shows as trusted because it is using HTTPS (HyperText Transfer
                        Protocol Secure) to secure the connection, which may prevent the man in the middle and spoofing
                        attacks. The site is probably using a valid SSL certificate and the connection is encrypted.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>3. What other ways are there to detect a phishing/scam site? Are there any
                            tools available online?</strong>

                    <p>
                        I think one of the main ways to detect a phishing or scam site is by checking the URL. Scammers
                        often try to make their website look like the real one by changing a letter or adding extra
                        ones, like ‚Äúdanskebankk‚Äù instead of ‚Äúdanske bank.‚Äù So, we really need to pay close attention to
                        the URL to make sure it‚Äôs correct.

                        Also, I think we need to look for HTTPS in the website‚Äôs address. If it‚Äôs missing, that‚Äôs a
                        major red flag. Another thing is to watch for any spelling mistakes or broken links on the site.
                        If it feels off or looks unprofessional, then it might be a scam site.

                        There are also some tools we can use to check if a site is safe. Websites like Google Safe
                        Browsing or VirusTotal can tell us if the site has been flagged as unsafe. I think it‚Äôs also a
                        good idea to use browser extensions that block malicious or phishing sites. Some antivirus
                        programs, like kaspersky also
                        have an option like safebrowsing, which can help protect us from these kinds of threats.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>4. What is typosquatting and how does it relate to the pictures?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Typosquatting is when cybercriminals register domain names that are very similar to real
                        websites but with small differences (like ‚Äúdanskebankk‚Äù or ‚Äúdanskebank.io‚Äù) in order to
                        trick users into visiting their fake site. In the pictures, the second URL (danskesbank.io)
                        might be an example of typosquatting, where the attacker uses a similar domain name to trick
                        users into thinking it‚Äôs the official Danske Bank site. It also has SSL, so the users may not notice the small
                        difference, which is why they might end up giving up their username and password on that phishing site.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>¬∞ What is UDRP and how does it help in combatting typosquatting?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        UDRP stands for Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy. It‚Äôs a policy created by ICANN
                        to help resolve disputes over domain names. If
                        someone uses a domain name that‚Äôs similar to a company name (like Danske Bank), the company
                        can file a complaint under the UDRP to get the domain taken down. This helps combat
                        typosquatting by providing a process for companies to protect their brand and prevent others
                        from using similar domains to trick users.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>¬∞ If you were to own the domain ouspg.org and would be running your crypto banking app
                            at bank.ouspg.org, what domains could you monitor for warning signs of possible phishing
                            attempts against your customers?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        If bank.ouspg.org was my domain, I would monitor other domains like:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>banks.ouspg.org (a common typo)</li>
                        <li>bank-ouspg.org (adding a hyphen)</li>
                        <li>ouspg-bank.org (swapping the name order)</li>
                        <li>oouspg.org (double letters are common)</li>
                        <li>ouspgg.org (extra letters or variations)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Also, I'd monitor some other similar TLDs like .net, .com, or .io that could be used by typosquatters to help protect my
                        website against phishing sites.
