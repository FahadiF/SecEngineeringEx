                    <strong>Task 1 (Summary):</strong> What measures have you taken to protect yourself from cyber
                    crimes? Write a short
                    description of the actions you have done to fortify your defenses towards all sorts of cyber crimes.
                    Have you been a victim of cyber crimes and do you think you could have prevented them? For example
                    phishing and malware attacks. What could you improve on?
                </div>

                    <p>
                        I am using a premium Antivirus to protect my Windows operated PC against viruses, malwares and
                        attacks from untrusted sources. I use an opensource password manager to store my passowords and
                        generate strong password for each and every website or application. Also use 2FA when possible.
                        I've
                        installed adblocker and vpn on browsers and avoid opening untrusted links. And I try to keep all
                        the
                        softwares and applications up to date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have been a victim of serious cyber attacks twice in my life. Once I got all my files
                        encrypted by
                        a ransomware attack, and the second time my personal information and data was stolen by a
                        malware.
                        Both of these attacks happened because I have used Modded OS and Softwares from untrusted
                        sources. I
                        was able to decrypt my data without paying the Bitcoin ransom by using a free decryption tool by
                        kaspersky.
                        But I lost a lot my personal data and information in the second attack. I could have prevented
                        these
                        attacks by avoiding using modded OS and softwares, and using trusted sources only.

                    <h3>Topic 1: Password Policy</h3>

                    <h4>Issue Statement:</h4>
                    <p>The employees are responsible for keeping our passwords safe. Passwords are the first line of
                        defense
                        against hackers, so we need some basic rules to make sure they‚Äôre strong and secure.</p>

                    <h4>Statement of the Organization's Position:</h4>
                    <p>We need everyone to use strong passwords, not something easy like "123456" or your name, phone
                        number, DOB etc. Passwords should be unique for every system, and you should change them every
                        couple of months. Don‚Äôt share your passwords with anyone, and keep them stored in a safe place
                        (maybe a password manager).</p>

                    <h4>Applicability:</h4>
                    <p>This applies to all employees who use company systems, accounts, or anything with sensitive data.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Roles and Responsibilities:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Employees:</strong> Create strong passwords and change them regularly.</li>
                        <li><strong>IT department:</strong> Make sure that all systems are well protected and assist if
                            there‚Äôs a problem with the system or passwords.</li>
                        <li><strong>Management:</strong> Make sure everyone knows the password policies and give
                            training if needed.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Compliance:</h4>
                    <p>If you don‚Äôt follow this policy, you may face consequences like account lockouts or warnings.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Points of Contact and Supplementary Information:</h4>
                    <p>If you need help with passwords, reach out to the IT Support team.</p>

                    <hr><br>

                    <h3>BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) Policy</h3>

                    <h4>Issue Statement:</h4>
                    <p>This policy is about using personal devices like phones, tablets, or laptops for work. We want to
                        make ssure that if you bring your own device, it should be secure and doesn‚Äôt put company's data
                        at risk.</p>

                    <h4>Statement of the Organization's Position:</h4>
                    <p>Employees are allowed to bring their own devices to work, but they must follow basic security
                        rules. Devices must have a password or PIN, and if you're using your device for work, you
                        must make sure that it is safe. No unauthorized apps or software from untrusted sources should
                        be installed. If you lose your device, it must be reported immediately.</p>

                    <h4>Applicability:</h4>
                    <p>This policy applies to all employees who use their personal devices to access company systems or
                        data,
                        whether at work or remotely.</p>

                    <h4>Roles and Responsibilities:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Employees:</strong> Make sure your device is secure and only use approved softwares
                            for
                            work-related tasks.</li>
                        <li><strong>IT Department:</strong> Monitor devices and ensure security, help employees with any
                            issues.</li>
                        <li><strong>Management:</strong> Make sure that everyone understands the policy and is provided
                            enough support
                            for securing devices.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Compliance:</h4>
                    <p>If you don‚Äôt follow the policy, there may be restrictions on using personal devices for work or
                        other actions depending on the situation.</p>

                    <h4>Points of Contact and Supplementary Information:</h4>
                    <p>If you need any help with securing your personal device or questions about the policy, contact
                        the IT
                        department.</p>
